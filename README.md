### Abstract

The current outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) in China and globally has caused an uproar all over the world and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. There are a lot of unknowns around this virus and its spread, that numerous visualization efforts to understand the growth and spread of this virus is still not sufficient to paint a complete picture. In this paper an endeavor has made to provide another point of view on how the spread of this virus can be interpreted by the means of unique visualizations such as choropleths and interactive visuals using bokeh, availing the covid data from The New York Times, based on reports from state and local health agencies ,google mobility information and open table data. Furthermore, in an effort to understand the effect of mobility on the pandemic, causal analysis has been applied to the datasets categorized by states.
